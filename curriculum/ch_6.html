<p>It is often challenging to choose sounds that work together when composing in EarSketch. This chapter provides strategies for planning your composition, choosing sounds, and transitioning between musical ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="tempo">Tempo</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tempo</strong> is the speed at which a piece of music is played. It affects the duration of each beat. Tempo is specified in beats per minute (bpm) in Western music. In EarSketch, we set the tempo of our song at the top of each script with <code>setTempo()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Songs of different genres fall within particular tempo ranges, especially in electronic music. Choosing a tempo can help define the track’s genre and where it will fit in a DJ set. The following tempos are typical of each of the following genres:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hip Hop: 85-95 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pop: 118 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techno: 120-125 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electro: 128 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>House: 115-130 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dubstep and Trap: 140 bpm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drum &amp; Bass: 160 - 180 bpm</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EarSketch Sound Library is organized into folders of related sounds, often by genre. Each sample’s tempo reflects where it fits in the list of genres above. If you would like to know the exact tempo of the sample, hover over the clip’s name in the Sound Browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the sounds do not have to be used with their original tempos or genre labels; the listed tempos are not set in stone. Certain genres, like rock or classical, have drastically varying tempos across their catalog. As you get more comfortable with EarSketch, try mixing sounds from different genres and experimenting with tempo. EarSketch will automatically play back the sounds you select from the sound library at the tempo you choose in <code>setTempo()</code>. In the end, your ear is what determines what tempo sounds best.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="pitch">Pitch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Pitch</strong> is a quality of sound that determines how high or low it sounds. Humans order relative musical tones on a <strong>scale</strong>, or set of musical notes, based on how they hear the frequency of the sound. This means pitch and frequency are related, but not synonymous. Pitch, duration, loudness, and timbre all factor into a complete musical tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>key</strong> of a song indicates the scale, or group of pitches, in which the music is composed. The key also specifies the home note, called the tonic, from which the pitches are drawn. Keys can be major or minor. Major keys tend to sound pleasant, while minor keys sound darker, although this is not always the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, sounds within the same folder in the EarSketch sound library are all in the same key, which helps you choose clips that sound good together. Your compositions do not need to be limited to a single folder; sometimes multiple sounds with related keys can be mixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listen to the audio clip below to hear the difference between major and minor keys:</p>

<h3 id="transitionstrategies">Transition Strategies</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Transitions</strong> are passages of music that combine neighboring musical sections. They can connect verse and chorus, build up to a drop, combine collaboratively written sections, mix between tracks (DJing), or change keys. The goal of a transition is to grab the listener’s attention and let them know a change is about to occur. Following are some popular strategies for creating musical transitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Crash Cymbal</strong>: Signaling a change by placing a crash cymbal on the first beat of a new section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drum Fill</strong>: A rhythmic variation used to fill the gap before a new section of music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track Dropouts</strong>: Making certain tracks temporarily drop out to create rests or pauses. This grabs the listener’s attention because the ear is used to repetition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Melody Variation</strong>: Introduce a variation of the chords, bassline, or melody before the new section. Often, a folder within the EarSketch sound library contains variations of a similar riff. For example, notice the sounds under the UK_HOUSE_ARPLEAD folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Riser</strong>: A sustained note or noise that increases in pitch. It is often paired with another transition technique and is extremely common in EDM music. Risers create an anticipation of a drop. EarSketch has a number of sounds labeled as risers; use the search term "riser" in the Sound Browser to check them out. A reversed crash cymbal can also be used as a riser, like YG_EDM_REVERSE_CRASH_1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drum fills are used throughout all genres of music, but are used notoriously in rock music. Check out the example below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind that a musical phrase sounds most natural when clips are arranged into groups of 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. This informs where a transition should be placed. In the example above, the first section occupies the first 8 measures and the second section occupies the next 8 measures. Therefore, we should place a transition right before the 9th measure, the start of the second section. Notice that the drums drop out briefly at measure 8, signaling a change to the listener.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An effective transition is not limited to a single technique. The next example uses multiple risers and a crash cymbal during the transition.</p>
