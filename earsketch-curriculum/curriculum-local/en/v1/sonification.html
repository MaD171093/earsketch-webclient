<p>It might seem strange to think about hearing a picture, but both music and images are just types of data in a computer. <strong>Sonification</strong> is a way to use audio to convey information, by turning data into sound.
Sonification has a lot of useful applications, like helping the visually impaired through sound. We can also use sonification to help us generate new musical materials that we might not otherwise think of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though you can sonify many different kinds of data, images are a fun place to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, how can we get music from an image? A digital image is really just made up of a lot of small pieces of data – and sonification lets us turn data into sound. Think about what happens when you zoom in on a picture, looking at it closer and closer. Eventually, you get to the smallest single component of an image. If you zoom in far enough, any image is just a lot of little squares of different colors. These are called <em>pixels</em>. Pixels are the smallest part of an image, with a big group of them making up the whole.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The color of each of these pixels is a piece of data. You can learn more about visuals and how computers store them in chapters 26 to 28. For now all you need to know is the computer can look at an image and tell what color each pixel is, producing numbers that you can use in EarSketch programs.</p>

<h3 id="multidimensionalData">Multidimensional Lists and Arrays</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now know that any image is made up of a large number of pixels, each of which has number values that represent colors and brightness. Consider this row of four (zoomed in) pixels:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These pixels are grayscale, so they’re easily represented by one number each that tells us how light or dark they are. Luminosity is on a scale of 0 to 255, from black (0) to white (255). The values of these four pixels are: 255, 189, 80, 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph curriculum-python">
<p>Remember our list data structure that can store any kind of information? The values of this row of pixels could be easily stored in a list.</p>

<h3 id="importimage">importImage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you’ve made a guess about the data, here’s a way for you to check it. If you want to work with images in EarSketch, you can use our <strong>importImage</strong> function that converts any image into data that can be used within EarSketch. <code>importImage</code> takes 3 required arguments (and one optional argument for color data). These are the 3 basic arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>importImage(imageURL, numberOfRows, numberOfColumns)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image URL is the source of the image, so you will have to use a picture on the Internet. If you have your own image file you want to sonify, you can use any online storage service to upload it to the internet. To get the URL of an image online, try right-clicking it and choosing “Copy Image Location”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number of rows and columns refers to the size of the matrix that <code>importImage</code> will return. The function actually divides the picture up into a grid of size numberOfRows x numberOfColumns, and returns the average value of each grid space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph curriculum-python">
<p>To convert the black-and-white grid image from above into a multidimensional list of pixels, right-click it to find and copy the image URL, and paste that in as your first argument. Choose 8 rows and 8 columns. It should look something like this:</p>

<p>You can also specify any list dimensions for the output – you don’t have to just use the original number of pixels. Our image here is only 8×8 pixels, which is very small. Imagine how many pixels most images you look at are! When you’re working with images in EarSketch, you probably won’t want to work with hundreds or thousands or millions of pixels – so instead, <code>importImage</code> lets you turn any image into a multidimensional list of whatever size you want. If you can’t decide what size to use, choosing “16″ for columns might work well, since that’s the number of sixteenth notes in an EarSketch measure and the number of measures in many musical phrases. For now, put in “8″ and “8″ for the number of rows and columns, to match the data for our 8×8 grid.</p>

<p>Some of the best images to use for sonification are those with an alternating pattern that can be used, for example, to create a beat string. It just so happens that QR codes typically have alternating (black and white) pixels with exactly these patterns.</p>
