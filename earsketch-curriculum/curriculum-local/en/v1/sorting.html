<p>In this section, we’ll learn more about what we can do with analysis features and lists. A list is a data structure that provides a way of storing and indexing many values in a single variable. These values will often be unsorted and just in the order we entered them in. However, we may want to order these values, such as from smallest to largest.

<p>This code sorts a list of similar audio clips according to their spectral centroids – darker clips are at the beginning of the list, and brighter clips are at the end. So, if you’re creating a song and need the “brightest” of the hip-hop guitar clips, you would pick a clip closer to the end of this list. You could also sort a list of audio clips based on their RMS amplitudes (as we will soon see) to help you select either louder or softer clips. One thing you could do is gradually change from one type of sound (e.g. dark) to another type (e.g. bright) by placing the sorted clips one after another on a track. This example illustrates how teaching computers to listen through Music Information Retrieval can help you compose music. Next, we’ll learn how to write the code to sort a list.</p>

<p>The method we will be using to sort lists is called a <strong>selection sort</strong>. This name is because with each “pass” through the list, it “selects” the smallest element in the list and puts it at the start. The sort uses a nested loop with two counters, one beginning at the beginning of the list, and one beginning at the next position in the list. The left counter remains fixed while the right counter steps through the list elements, comparing each to the element at the left counter. Any time the element at the right counter is less than the element at the left counter, the two elements are swapped. So, at the end of the first “pass” through the list, the first element in the list is also the smallest. The process then repeats with the left counter starting at the second position in the list and the right counter starting at the third position; after this pass, the second element in the list is the second smallest. The process repeats until the list is sorted. Let’s take a look at how the selection sort works – here is some code that creates a list of five audio clips and sorts this list based on their RMS amplitudes, from low to high:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Swapping the left and right clips uses a very common programming technique called a “swap” of two variables. At line 26, a new <code>temp</code> variable is defined to temporarily hold the left clip. Then at line 27, the value in <code>clipsList[leftCounter]</code> is updated to the right clip (specifically, the value at <code>clipsList[rightCounter]</code>. Lastly, at line 28, the <code>clipsList[rightCounter]</code> value is updated to the original “left” clip. The end result is to swap the two values, thus sorting the two clips by their RMS amplitude!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the first iteration of the outer for-loop (at line 15), after the inner for-loop (at line 17) has finished all of its iterations, the first element in <code>clipsList</code> will be the clip with the smallest RMS amplitude. Then, <code>leftCounter</code> is incremented in the outer for-loop, and the process starts over, this time with <code>leftCounter</code> starting at the second element in the list and <code>rightCounter</code> starting at the third. The sort algorithm continues in this manner, placing clips with successively larger RMS amplitudes at successive positions in the list, until the entire list is sorted in order of ascending RMS amplitude. If this is confusing, view the animated graphic of selection sort in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort" target="_blank">selection sort Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last part of our code adds each element in our sorted list (which should now contain all of our audio clips in order from those with the lowest RMS amplitude to those with the highest) to track 1, allowing us to play them in order and hear the increase in RMS amplitude from clip to clip.</p>
