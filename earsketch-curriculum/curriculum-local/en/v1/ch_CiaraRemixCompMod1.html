<p>The challenge is out…​ it’s time to start making music. Your song for this competition will be a remix including one or more clips from <strong>Ciara’s hit song "Set"</strong> off her latest album: <em>Beauty Marks</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about Ciara – you can view her biography on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ciara is excited to see how you can creatively remix her music. Many of you may have heard the term remix as you listen to today’s top hits on the radio. Remixing a piece of music gives it a new life—it changes its style, mood, tempo, and harmony.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this competition, you will use one or more sound clips from Ciara to create a new piece of music inspired by her work.  ou may remix her clips with sound files by other artists provided by (and possibly some that you may upload on your own). You may also layer your own vocals or instrumentals into the remix to showcase your musical talent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>How cool would it be to mix your own music with Ciara’s?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how do you get started? Let’s take a look at a short song in EarSketch that remixes some of Ciara’s stems. Follow the directions below to begin your coding experience.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you begin coding in EarSketch, we will focus on arguments including numbers, variables, and constants. <code>setTempo()</code> is an example of a function with a number.</p>

<p>In your script, you will see the number <code>120</code> in parentheses after the setTempo function. This tells the computer the number of beats per minute (the speed or pace of the song). One way to remix music is change the tempo, like taking a slower song and speeding it up for dancing.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time to keep dancing forward. line 19 contains the function <code>fitMedia()</code> that allows you to play
sound clips. Sound clips are organized in rows called tracks on a timeline that shows time in
both seconds and measures. Using <code>fitMedia()</code> on its own won’t automatically play the music.
You will need to provide the arguments in order for the computer to know what to do.
<code>fitMedia()</code> function takes in four input arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>sound clip name</p>

<p>Look at line 19 of our code. <code>fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,8)</code></p>

<p>This means that the sound clip <code>RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8</code>. will be played on track 1,
starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 8.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>EarSketch has an extensive library of sound clips. You can find sound clips from genres such as R&amp;B, Hip Hop , EDM, House, Pop and Funk (and many more) and from over 300 different instrument samples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of these sound clips have been created by the recording artists and sound engineers: Richard Devine and Young Guru.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Young Guru</em>, is a grammy-nominated sound engineer, record producer, disc jockey, and record executive. Young Guru has worked with many lead recording artists including Jay-Z.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Richard Devine</em> is an electronic musician and sound designer famous for producing a layered and heavily processed sound. He has composed scores for commercials and many recordings that have been composed on the computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this competition, we have also added <em>Ciara’s</em> sound clips to the sound library. You can also add your own sound clips (we will show you how to do this in Module 2)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How to add sound clips</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Access the sound library by clicking the folder with the headphones just below the EarSketch logo. <span class="image"><img alt="img9" src="http://localhost:8888/curriculum/curriculum/media/CiaraRemixComp/img9.png"/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for sounds, by artist, genre and instrument. In the sound collections menu, there will also be suggestions for sounds that fit your script or sounds used by others who have searched similar sounds. <span class="image"><img alt="img10" src="http://localhost:8888/curriculum/curriculum/media/CiaraRemixComp/img10.png"/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the green play button next to the name of the sound clip to listen to it and decide if you want to add it to your script. <span class="image"><img alt="img11" src="http://localhost:8888/curriculum/curriculum/media/CiaraRemixComp/img11.png"/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decide to add it to your script, use the blue clipboard icon to paste the sound clip into your <code>fitMedia()</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the track, starting measure, and ending measure of your sound clip. Let’s practice in this next activity. <code>fitMedia(RD_FUTURE_DEBSTEP_PERC_1,6,2,6)</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Student Activity: Adding Sound Clips</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you will have the opportunity to add some of your own sound clip choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Go to line 25 and type in <code>fitMedia()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to your sound browser and search for a sound (maybe one from Ciara) that you think would fit well in this song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have found your desired sound clip, click the blue clipboard icon to paste it in the <code>fitMedia()</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next argument in <code>fitMedia()</code> is the track. We are going to assign this sound clip to track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a comma next to your sound clip and then the number <code>6</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next two arguments are start and end measure. Choose a start measure (between 1 and 8) to start playing your music and end measure (between 2 and 9) to end your music. Your end measure must be a larger number than your start measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check to make sure you have commas between your arguments and have closed your parentheses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click run and play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you hear your new sound clip? How does it fit in with your song?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can continue to add sound clips or change the sound clips in the <code>fitMedia()</code> functions from lines 19-24. If you are adding tracks, start at track 10 to avoid overlapping tracks.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="BuildingBlocksVarsConst">Variables and Constants</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last two building blocks of our basic script are variables and constants. A constant stores a value that never changes. An example of a constant is our sound clip file <code>HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002</code> . This file is assigned to a single value (the sound that it plays).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Variables are a way to store information within a script. Variables can represent anything including numbers and clip names. To use variables, we need to give the variable a name and then assign it a value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, I may want to use the sound file <code>HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002</code> multiple times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s a cool beat and I may want to have it loop through the song. Instead of copying and pasting the whole sound clip, I can assign the variable groove to represent that clip ex: <code>groove=HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002</code> This will save me time and space in writing my code. It also makes it easier to experiment with different sounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I decide that <code>HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002</code> is not actually the beat I want in my song, and instead I want <code>RD_FUTURE_DUBSTEP_PERC_1</code>, I can simply change the groove variable and it will update everywhere that beat is used in the whole song. For example <code>groove=RD_FUTURE_DUBSTEP_PERC_1</code></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our script, lines 11-15 showed my assigned variables. In line 11, I assigned the variable groove to the value <code>HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002</code>.
