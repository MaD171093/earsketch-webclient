<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome back students!  We are ready to start Module 3 of <strong>Your Voice Is Power Learning Experience</strong>  You continue to investigate how music, computer science, and entrepreneurship are pathways to promote racial equity and gain additional skills to help you code your
final song for the competition. You will hear the stories of amazing entrepreneurs who “set their own tempo,” before learning to code your own unique beat and tempo in EarSketch.”</p>

<p>Let’s start off today by studying the chorus of "Entrepreneur"  Click on the Entrepreneur audio below  to listen to the chorus twice. The first time you listen to the chorus, think about the meaning of the lyrics. What themes from Dr. Wilson’s OUTKAST Imagination Framework do you hear?  Listen to the file again, think about the beat of the song.  How does it make you feel?  What is the mood of the song?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is the chorus fast or slow?  Would your mood change if the speed of the song changed?
By speeding up or slowing down the song, we are changing the <strong>tempo</strong> of the song. The
tempo of the song is the speed or pace of the song. This is often what determines the mood
of your song. It may signal whether you want to get up and dance, or sit back and relax. We’ll
explore tempo more in today’s lesson and think about how the tempo can “influence” the
message of the song.”</p>

<p>Let’s listen to Dr. Wilson to check in on our lyric analysis before we dive into learning more
about different Entrepreneurs</p>

<p>Before we start adding to our code, we are going to learn a little bit more about entrepreneurship and why it is so important for racial equity!  Your first question may be — What is an Entrepreneur?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> is one who starts, manages, or assumes the risk of a business or enterprise.</p>

<h3 id="_tempo">Tempo</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These entrepreneurs have set their own tempo to defy the odds. Now it’s your turn to set
the tempo of your code and make your message heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tempo</strong> is the speed of a given piece of music (or
the number of beats per minute).
A <strong>beat</strong> is the basic unit of musical time. Beats give your song rhythm and let you move and dance to the feel of the music! The faster the beat, the higher the tempo!
Slower beats means a slower tempo. Beats and tempo determine the mood of a song</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you know a little bit about the basics of time in music, let’s learn more about the tempo of Entrepreneur, and watch Chalece and Mike code the chorus of Entrepreneur on EarSketch in the video below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different genres of music often have different tempo ranges.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Hip-Hop: 85-95 bpm
Pop: 118 bpm
Techno: 120-125 bpm
Electro: 128 bpm
House: 115-130 bpm
Dubstep and Trap: 140 bpm
Drum &amp; Bass: 160-180 bpm</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What do you think the tempo of
Entrepreneur is?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is 83. This means that the song Entrepreneur plays 83 beats per minute.  Did that surprise you? Is this faster or slower than you guessed? Try listening and counting the beats to see if you can determine the tempo of some of your favorite songs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_change_your_tempo">Change Your Tempo</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changing the tempo is a great way to remix a song — you
can edit one number in EarSketch and change a slow song
into a techno dance hit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look at the opening lines of code of your script. You should see the function <code>setTempo()</code>.  This is an example of a function with a number. You will see the number 120 in parentheses after
the <code>setTempo()</code> function. This tells the computer the number of beats per minute. Every EarSketch script opens with a baseline tempo of 120 beats per minute—a fast walk or marching speed. Follow the directions below to "remix" the tempo of your song.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Student Activity: Tempo</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.Click in the parentheses next to setTempo() and change the number (40-220 BPM)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2.Run your code and listen to your song.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.Try a different number or tempo and see how it “remixes” your music.” Remember to
run your code every time you change your tempo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does changing the tempo affect the mood of your song?  In EarSketch, you can only use the function <code>setTempo()</code> one time.  The tempo you choose will be the tempo for your whole song.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_defining_measures">Defining Measures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chalece and Mike started to build their song today — now it is your turn. Chalece discusses
building the song in blocks of 4 and 8. Why do we do this? In music, beats are grouped into
groups of 4. Each group of 4 beats is called a <strong>measure</strong> (or note). Each beat is a quarter note
in a piece of music. One measure has 4 quarter notes or 4 beats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img alt="Mod3 Image2 measure" src="http://localhost:8888/curriculum/curriculum/media/YVIP-RemixComp/Mod3-Image2-measure.png"/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look at your Digital Audio Workstation.  You will see that the top row measures <strong>time in seconds</strong> and the bottom row shows the <strong>measure markers</strong>.  How many seconds are in each measure on your DAW?  The answer will depend on your tempo. If you set your tempo to 120 bpm, you should see 2 seconds for each measure. Try changing your tempo using the <code>setTempo()</code> function and see how the number of seconds changes for each measure.  A measure (in EarSketch) will always have 4 beats, but the time it takes to play those four beats will change depending on tempo.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_building_your_16_measure_song">Building Your 16 Measure Song</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have you heard many songs that are only 8 seconds long? Maybe only on TikTok. Your remix song will need to be at least 30 seconds or 16 measures. So, how do you extend your 8 second (4 measure) song to 30 seconds or 16 measures)? Any ideas from the video on how to do this?”</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can change the starting or ending measure of your <code>fitMedia()</code> functions to stagger the start and end times of your tracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add more tracks to your song that start at measure 5 or later.</p>

<p>Look at your DAW, do you see the sound clips staggered over nine measures? How did the position of your soundclips along your timeline change from your code in module 2.  When you listen to the song, do you hear how sounds fade in and out and overlap?  Staggering start and end times of sound clips is very common in Entrepreneur or another one of your favorite songs. In fact, Mike points out to Chalece, that the first measure of Entrepreneur is silent. The first soundclip starts on measure 2.</p>
