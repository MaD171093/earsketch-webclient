<p>Are you ready? The time is now to create your remix. For your final challenge,
you will code a song in EarSketch remixing stems from Pharrell’s song Entrepreneur that uses
your “voice” (or includes a message). Think about the call to action and how you can build on your EarSketch knowledge to use code to express your voice.  Below you will find resources to help you continue to work on your submission.  When you have completed your code, debug (see directions below) and then submit to the competition.  Pharrell is so excited to see what you can produce.</p>

<h4 id="_debugging">Debugging</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have finished your code, you need to go through a final check for errors called the <strong>debugging process</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Follow the instructions below to debug your code:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Run your code</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the console - are there any errors?</strong></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If there are no errors, move on to  Part 2 in the song submission process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an error in your code, continue to step 3 in the debugging process</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the console for clues</strong> (such as line number or type of error).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locate the error in your code:</strong> If the console provided a line number, take a look at that line and the previous line in your code. Check any arguments carefully. You can also comment out the lines of code one at a time to identify where a possible error could be.
5.* Print debugging* can also be used to locate an error. Insert print statements throughout your code to obtain the value of variables and check your logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Squash the bug:</strong> Check for syntax errors, like unclosed parentheses, quotations, or brackets. Edit the ode, and run it to verify its correctness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask for help:</strong> If you find you have spent too much time on a bug, then ask someone for help! A fresh pair of eyes can do wonders for spotting mistakes.</p>
