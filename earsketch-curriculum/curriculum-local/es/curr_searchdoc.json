Furthermore, musical repetition has the profound effect of drawing the listener into the music, making us feel as if we are participating rather than just listening. Upon hearing a repeated section of music, the brain will try to imagine the next note before it is actually played. This same effect contributes to earworms, or music getting \"stuck\" in your head. Likewise, each time a section of music is repeated, the listener tends to notice different details of the piece.

In coding and music practices, teams often work together to produce better products\u2014\u200bcomposers often team up with musicians, recording engineers, and producers to make an album. Similarly, programmers divide tasks and roles, such as in pair programming, where one individual \"drives\" (writes the code) and another person \"navigates\" (reviews each line as it is written).
